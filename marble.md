   Quartz has become an increasingly popular countertop option for homeowners looking to upgrade to durable, maintenance-free stones. There are many advantages to selecting quartz, such as endless color and pattern variations from dozens of manufacturers, easy cleaning, and scratch-and-stain-resistance. Unlike natural stones, quartz is engineered, which makes it non-porous. While granite countertops and other natural stones are known for their beauty, quartz can manage to mimic the appearance of those stones in many cases.

However, when shopping for quartz you will quickly notice large price deviations between the seemingly similar products. Quartz countertop costs are driven by many factors, with the largest being the manufacturer. Manufacturers tend to use different techniques when producing quartz slabs, and this factor alone is enough to drive the prices higher.

There are plenty of other contributing factors that greatly influence price, such as country of origin, so we will be breaking down the basics below.

How Much Do Quartz Countertops Cost?
When budgeting for a quartz countertop, you can expect to spend anywhere between $45 and $75 per square foot for installed material. Note that countertop edges and cutouts can also have an impact on that price. Our easy to use countertop estimator will help create the quote for your project. With many brands available through fabricators today, you will most often encounter Caesarstone, Silestone, and Cambria, all of which will have material available at the cost mentioned above.

The quartz slabs available in the $45 to $55 range are typically plain in color, and offer little to no speckling or veining. The $55 to $65 range stone will provide some more color options, and the slabs may have consistent speckles throughout. Or, this price point may offer color options such as red and blue. Quartz with veining similar to that of Carrara and Calacatta marble will often be in the $75 or higher price point range, and is a great alternative to the softer, natural stone.

Quality of Quartz vs. Price
There is often a direct correlation between the quality of a product and its price, and this remains true when you are shopping for quartz countertops. Since quartz has gained its popularity in homes around the world, there has been a steady increase of slab manufacturers to meet the demand. It’s important to note, however, that not all of them are the same.

Trusted names in the manufacturers industry, like Caesarstone, have been perfecting their slab manufacturing techniques for decades, and have the reputation for being the best on the market. This is largely thanks to their high quality of materials and their warranties. The assurance provided by the company does come with a higher price tag, but it also offers shoppers peace of mind.

While there are more than a handful of trusted companies, some of the cheaper products may come with imperfections, like color pooling and resin pooling. Since slabs are created by combining ground-up quartz, resin and dye, it is not uncommon to notice certain areas where more resin or dye are more concentrated, creating an uneven overall look. It is important to view each slab before it enters fabrication for your home improvement project, and to exercise caution if a fabricator is unwilling to make accommodations for you to view the stone.

Price Factors
WHAT DETERMINES QUARTZ COUNTERTOP COSTS?
Availability
Layout
Edging
Cutouts
Travel Distance to the Job Site
Total Size of the Job
If a fabricator has slabs of quartz in stock, it will often be far cheaper than searching for slabs through suppliers and having them delivered. Make sure to always check for availability in advance. The layout of your project plays an important role here as well. On average, a slab of quartz will be around 50 sq. feet, but the nature of your project may only use a portion of that slab or call for seams in undesirable places.

It is important to remember that there are also several other factors which contribute to the price of the countertops outside of the material. After you have selected a slab, the fabricators will need to account for edging, cutouts, travel distance required to get to the job site, the labor of the installers and the total size of the job to provide an accurate estimate for the project as a whole.

Also note that keeping the finished edges straight or quarter round will keep the price to a minimum, while premium edge options such as Ogee or Dupont will have a significant impact on the price.

Making the Final Decision
Selecting a stone that best fits your décor is just as important as its durability and cost. Shop around to find a fabricator that is properly equipped to handle your specific project and is able to create a level of detail that you desire. Make sure to finalize your layout with a designer in advance if possible, even prior to shopping for the best price, as it may determine the amount of raw material necessary and remember to include all other potential expenses to accurately calculate quartz countertop costs.

Ultimately, if you keep all of the above in mind when shopping for quartz countertops, you should avoid some of the common pitfalls other buyers experience. More importantly, you’ll end up more than satisfied with the final product.
